# Amazon_Sales_EDA
This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Amazon Sales Data, aimed at uncovering key insights into sales performance across regions, item types, and sales channels. The analysis dives into trends, patterns, and factors influencing sales and profit, using Python and popular libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Excited to share my latest project where I conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Amazon Sales Data! 📊

The goal of this project was to uncover key insights into sales performance across different regions, item types, and sales channels. Here’s a quick rundown of my process:

🔍 **1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:**

- Imported and explored the dataset to understand its structure.
- Handled missing values and ensured data types were correctly formatted.

📈 **2. Exploratory Analysis:**

- Analyzed total sales revenue across different regions to identify top-performing markets.
- Examined the average unit price and unit cost for each item type.
- Investigated which countries generated the highest total profit.
- Explored the relationship between sales channels and order priority distribution.

🔬 **3. Visualizations and Insights:**

- Visualized the distribution of unit prices across item types.
- Identified trends in order priorities across various regions.
- Assessed the correlation between unit price and total profit.
- Analyzed seasonal trends and patterns in the sales data.

🔄 **4. Key Takeaways:**

- Highlighted regions and countries contributing the most to total sales and profit.
- Uncovered insights into how different sales channels impact order priorities.
- Discovered patterns that could help optimize sales strategies.

Working on this project helped me sharpen my data analysis skills and gain deeper insights into sales performance. I used tools like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to make the analysis more intuitive and visually appealing.

I’m excited to keep growing and sharing my data journey! Feedback is always welcome. 🚀
